# About

This exercise is to explore how we might go about thinking about the techniques we covered, __and__ combine supervised tasks!

- Work in teams.  You should submit using the same team name each time 
- This works like a kaggle leaderboard (just for fun!)
- Iterate.  How can we try to model the data but to increase accuracy, but iterate and do so incrementally!


## Exercise

You have been given a dataset of features that represent images of ten different types of articles of clothing.  The 
features are the pixels of each image.  

Your goal is to fit a model (start small!) to predict the type label.  After fitting your model, apply it to the 
test dataset and upload a file that matches the setup of the Sample Submission to the leaderboard above.

This is meant to have fun, but also to help practice and connect the tools and skills we have seen in the program!


## Datasets (all are csvs)

- Training features: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eSlkv7jR_eYkrq2m0qJm0cdczdYhLRl/view?usp=sharing
- Training labels: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eSlkv7jR_eYkrq2m0qJm0cdczdYhLRl/view?usp=sharing
- Test features: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-pEhPF3Sr4FNxt4-HEy3mI6FfH4wk1cd/view?usp=sharing

> You can merge the training label onto the training features based on the 'id' column

Please review the submission file.  This has the id and a predicted label.  Your file should match this when uploading
to the leaderboard, and while fail if it doesnt match this idea.
